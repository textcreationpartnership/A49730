            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

have felt, what was then onely foreſeen, if by Gods good Providence, and the Kings Wiſdom, this War had not been made. I did at that time recommend to you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider His Honour, His Intereſt, and your own Security (which are certainly moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable) and to lay down ſuch Real and Effectual Ways, that the Forces of this Kingdom might be ſupplied, to ſerve His Majeſty upon occaſion, to be a Terrour to His Enemies, and a Security to this His Kingdom. You then did moſt cheerfully raiſe ſuch a Sum, as might probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt any Forreign Invaſion, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Commotion the Enemy could raiſe here: For which, His Majeſty does again return you His Hearty Thanks. He hath not diverted any of it from the Ends for which it was granted; And ſo great were His Naval Preparations, together with His Land Forces this laſt Summer, that He had great reaſon to have expected a Juſt and Honourable Peace: But ſuch hath been the inſolent ſtubbornneſs of His Enemies, that He is diſappointed of that hope.</p>
            <p>Therefore He did command me to keep this Seſsion of Parliament at this day, to

which was many moneths ago Adjourn'd; and as He acquainted you with the Motives of the War, ſo to let you know how He hath uſed all means poſsible for ending it. The <hi>Swedes</hi> (who are the Mediators) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Treaty: His Majeſty accepted it, and offered <hi>Dunkirk</hi> as the moſt convenient Place for all that were concerned in the War, to Treat in; But the Enemy refuſed it, though His Majeſty had treated with them at their own Town of <hi>Breda</hi> during the laſt War. The Mediators propoſed a Ceſſation of Arms, before any Engagement laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; His Majeſty agreed to it: But the Enemy inſolently refuſed it alſo; And the King accepted of the City of <hi>Cologn,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Enemy for the place of Treaty. Thither he ſent His Plenipotentiaries with reaſonable Propoſals, and thoſe He did ſo moderate, that the Mediators declared; they were not reaſonably to be refuſed: Yet the Enemy have been ſo very averſe to Peace, that they would never declare what would ſatisfie them, nor ſo much as Anſwer any Propoſal made by the Mediators for the King or His Allies: Nay, ſuch was their inſolence, that they gave in Papers, ſtuffed

with ſuch unhandſome Language, that the Mediators were aſhamed, and refuſed to ſhew them. Therefore the King is forced to continue the War, for His own Honour, the maintenance of His Juſt Rights, and the Protection of all His Subjects; wherein He doubts not of the hearty concurrence of this and of all His Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Another main reaſon of keeping this Seſsion of Parliament, is, to joyn with you, in taking ſuch effectual courſe, for curbing and puniſhing inſolent Field-Conventicles, and other Seditious practiſes, as that the good Laws you have made, may receive due Obedience, and that Peace and Order may be preſerved in this Kingdom. The Ways and Means for this good End He leaves to your Wiſdom, not doubting of the ſame Care and Affection to His Service in this, which he hath found all along from you. And whereas the malicious Tongues of the Diſaffected may ſtill beſpatter His Majeſty and His Government with baſe Slanders, and falſe Suggeſtions, I am again particularly commanded to renew to you the fulleſt Aſſurance of His Majeſties moſt conſtant continuance, in His firm and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
